I am a lecturer and research fellow at [Griffith University](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/academic/i.bar), using a range of molecular, genomics and informatics methods to investigate productivity traits in agriculture crops, currently focusing on host-pathogen interactoins in legumes. I enjoy teaching and sharing the skills and knowledge that I acquired throughout my scientific journey (which is why I setup this website). I do it through lecturing ([Applied Bioinformatics](https://degrees.griffith.edu.au/Course/3030NSC)) and non-formally as a regular instructor in Griffith University's [HackyHour](https://hackyhourgriffith.wordpress.com/), delivering Software Carpenty workshops and through my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DrIdoBar).
