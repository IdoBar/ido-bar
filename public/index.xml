      <description>I am a lecturer and research fellow at Griffith University, using a range of molecular, genomics and informatics methods to investigate productivity traits in agriculture crops, currently focusing on host-pathogen interactoins in legumes. I enjoy teaching and sharing the skills and knowledge that I acquired throughout my scientific journey (which is why I setup this website). I do it through lecturing (Applied Bioinformatics) and non-formally as a regular instructor in Griffith University&amp;rsquo;s HackyHour, delivering Software Carpenty workshops and through my Twitter account.</description>

Code/Rag has always been more than just another online tech blog. We strive to be part of the tech community—serving an essential, fundamental look at what’s going on in the valley. It’s why our tagline is “Know Your Code.” We think a tech news publication should know the basics. Be the source. Get down to brass tacks. We can do that because we’re part of the very ecosystem we’re reporting on.</description>
